# Stroke-prediction-

As the second most common cause of death in the world [1], a stroke can affect every 
individual’s health significantly. The capability of predicting whether an individual may have 
a stroke or not allows the individual to seek prevention or treatment early to lower the risk 
of a stroke.

In this project, we are interested in exploring various machine learning techniques to 
predict whether an individual will have a stroke given the dataset [2]. By comparing the 
performance of these different techniques, we can identify the more reliable solution to 
provide stroke prediction results to the public, healthcare professionals, and insurance 
companies. More specifically, we intend to explore the following questions.

• How do different machine learning models’ performances compare on this dataset 
based on metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, recall score, etc.?

• How do we account for an imbalance in the dataset? Which machine learning and 
deep learning-based methods have demonstrated superior performance for tackling 
imbalance?

• How do we measure and monitor the distribution shifts in the datasets? In addition, 
we would like to review the existing methods to account for shifts and, if time permits, 
implement them for the chosen problem.
